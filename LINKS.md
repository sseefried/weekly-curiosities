Quote 1
>  _The worst treatment you tend to get is, perhaps counterintuitively, in jobs
>  that approach living wage despite your low value and replaceability as a
>  worker. These jobs tend towards needing someone who can put in a lot of hours
>  for customer interactions that require a single point of contact; they reward
>  intense focus over long periods of time in unpleasant situations. Another way
>  to say this is that these are high-stress jobs with a lot of mandatory
>  overtime and very fast pacing - they pay a lot because they can’t get people
>  to do them otherwise. Turnover in these jobs is absurd despite the pay - some
>  people can keep up with them but it isn’t typical. In my first (and hopefully
>  last) claims adjuster job, two people had heart attacks in my office in a six
>  month period._

Quote 2

> Rich person tip: Unless you really, really need everything in your house to
> clearly be part of a unified set, you are a sucker if you buy furniture new;
> this is especially true for non-upholstered wooden furniture. Antique
> furniture is prettier, studier, has more street cred and can be had for a song
> compared to retail store prices; let other people pay those and look average
> while you put in a minimum effort, save money, and get cooler older furniture
> that makes you look like a person of taste rather than an every day
> jive-turkey retail sucker.

Quote 3

> And if you do better than I do - say, if you are a person who completed
> college on time and went on to your deserved place in the upper-middle class -
> I hereby command you not to feel bad about it. It’s OK to do well, and I have
> an idea of the kind of work you’ve put in to get to where you are; there’s a
> great chance you deserve to have the things you have. I hope this was
> instructive for you, and I wish you continued success.
