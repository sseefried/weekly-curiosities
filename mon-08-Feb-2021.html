<h1>Meditation sometimes harmful, astronomical paradoxes and clear wood</h1>
<h2>Tue 09 Feb 2021</h2>

Welcome to the first edition of my Weekly Curiosities newsletter. The name may
change, but the content probably will not. This newsletter is really just a
place for me to share stuff I came across that I found interesting, and a place
to cultivate my writing and communications skills. Let's start.

<h2><a href="https://vividness.live/meditation-risks">Meditation can be bad for you?</a></h2>

<p>Have you ever heard that meditation could, under certain circumstances, be
harmful? I certainly hadn't. It was such an interesting view that I just had to
read David Chapman's take on it. Now, let's be clear, he doesn't say it's always
harmful or even mostly harmful just that it _can_ be harmful. The basic gist is
that _depersonalisation_ can result from practice of intentionally
trying to annihilate the self in Mindfulness.

<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MCt3AxCL6I">Why is the night sky not just one big white sheet?</a></h2>

<p>It's not immediately obvious why the entire night sky is not just one big white
sheet. If we live in an infinite universe with infinite stars - the consensus
view - at least some of the light from even far away stars is going to reach us.
Also the further away a star is the more stars there are at that radius, so that
should mean more light. So why the big, dark gaps in between stars in the night
sky?</p>

<p><em>Up and Atom</em> does a great job of explaining it in the video below.
Apart from being an Aussie who does science communication videos, I'm a big fan
of her fun andvery enthusiastic style of presentation.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2020/10/01/transparent-wood-could-be-window-future">Transparent wood is now a thing</a></h2>

<p>Apparently some clever scientists have managed to make wood _transparent_.
Perhaps this is what windows of the future will be made of?</p>
