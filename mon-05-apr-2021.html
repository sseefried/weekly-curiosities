<p>I took up surfing when I was 30 and did it regularly for a year. However, one
thing that struck me about this amazing sport is that you get far fewer waves
than you might first think.</p>

<p>After you've gotten out past the breakers you have to contend with the fact
that not every wave is suitable, even on a good day. Worse still, when the surf
is good, there are many other people lining up for their turn. Many waves will
only have one or two "sweet spots" that are suitable for surfing and one must
never forget that "dropping in" on another surfer is a cardinal sin that can
lead to all sorts of "agro".</p>

<p>When you take all these factors into account you might only be getting a
chance to surf a wave every 15 minutes. Combine this with the fact that a ride
on a wave might only last a few seconds, up to a minute at most, and you can
quickly see that becoming good at surfing requires dedication. This
isn't necessarily a problem as the experience of being out in the surf is
enjoyable in and of itself, but it does mean that you have to expend a lot of
time to get good.</p>

<p>There might be a solution. The fancy new wave generator below, developed by
Surf Lakes, looks like a great way to catch more waves per hour. I don't think
it will, or even should, replace proper surfing but it could be a great aid for
new surfers in much the same way that ball launchers are a useful tool for
tennis/baseball/cricket players to improve their hits.</p>

<h2><a href="https://residentcontrarian.substack.com/p/on-the-exciting-subject-of-earwax">Are cotton earbuds dangerous?</a></h2>

<p>It's well known that cotton earbuds are dangerous for your ears, right? Well,
maybe not according to the author of this article. Generally, I think that an
education qualification (e.g. MD) is a good proxy for knowing what you're
talking about. But good proxy does not equal 100% accuracy. Occasionally an
outsider with good reasoning skills can notice a discrepancy in a knowledge
base, assemble evidence that the mainstream belief is bullshit, and set the
record straight.</p>

<p>Have a read and see if you think that's what has happened here.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-03-02/berlin-s-rent-controls-are-proving-to-be-the-disaster-we-feared">Rent control has split Berlin market in two and failed in its aims</a></h2>

<p>Some ideas, such as price control, have been tried repeatedly over time and it
seems with little success. As the author of this article states it merely trades
one problem for another: high prices become empty shelves. The only real solution
is more supply.</p>

<p>If there's one thing I would encourage people to do it is not to stick to a
preconceived belief when reality keeps proving you wrong. Be adaptable. Be
willing to find out what really works and solve the problem that way. Reality is
not as simple as you think it is.</p>

<p>This article presents a lovely "natural experiment" in which two different
housing markets in Berlin are examined. One market has rent control, the other
does not. Although the rents drop in the former market, as expected, so does
the supply. Vacancy rates drop to a trickle. Conversely, in the unregulated market
for new buildings, prices increase even faster than before rent control was introduced
in the other market. The problem of inadequate supply has merely been pushed
somewhere else.</p>

<h2><a href="">Bitcoin is not truly fungible</a></h2>

<p>If you haven't seen the word "fungible" before it's a great one to add to
your vocabulary. It simply means that one example of a thing is
indistinguishable from another for a given purpose. </p>

<p>For instance, in theory, a 5 dollar note should buy you just as
many goods and services as another 5 dollar note. Most of the time this is true,
but this breaks down when money gets stolen and a whole swathe of notes with certain
serial numbers are declared "dirty" and hence un-spendable.</p>

<p>It turns out that Bitcoin also has this problem. Some transactions on its
global distributed ledger have been linked to nefarious activities and hence,
no one will accept Bitcoin coming from those addresses. The website below
collects examples of non-fungible Bitcoins for your edification.</p>
