<p>I believe in progress even if we don't always achieve it. Because of this my
natural inclination is to reflexively question tradition and discard it when
appropriate. However, within the last decade I've come to realise just how hard
it is to change things for the better. e.g. Facebook has not be a nett good for
society. </p>

<p>A lot of our society's ways of doing things have deep reasons for being that
are not immediately apparent. This can be summed up by the adage, due to <a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7659686-tradition-is-a-set-of-solutions-for-which-we-have">Donald
Kingsbury</a>, that <em>tradition is a set of solutions for which we have
forgotten the problems</em>. This is why it is particularly instructional to see
examples of situations where someone discards tradition and quickly discovers why
that tradition existed in the first place.</p>

<p>The article below documents an experiment where a company tried to
pay all of its employees the same salary regardless of experience or
how motivated each employee was. The experiment had to be abandoned
fairly quickly once it was clear it was sowing discord among the
employees.</p>

<p>I thought I'd post a drone video of mine here from time to time. I hope
  you don't mind</p>

<p>In this week's video I tried to fly very differently to the way I normally do.
The result was a "slow and floaty" style of flying that results in a much more
meditative and chilled feel.</p>
