<h1>Finite sums for an infinite divergent sequence, how to think about your diet, and the toxicity of the 30-year mortgage</h1>

<p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was probably one of the most interesting mathematicians
of the 20th century. He grew up in a poor family in a remote part of India. Not
only was he not provided with a high quality mathematical education but &mdash;
after he had defied the odds and developed a prodigious ability &mdash he had no
one around him that could even recognise his achievements. </p>

<p>At the age of 26 he wrote a <a
href="https://medium.com/cantors-paradise/ramanujans-first-letter-to-g-h-hardy-1913-33244f545e80">letter</a>
to the famous mathematician G. H. Hardy. Hardy was not put off by Ramanujan's
lack of formal education and immediately recognised his ability and originality.
The Hollywood trope of the established professional that can't  recognise genius
and only cares for credentials did not hold in this case.</p>

<p>One of the results Ramanujan submitted in the letter concerned a summation of
ordinary, whole numbers (i.e. the _natural numbers_ in mathematics). He made the
claim that if you broke one of the rules of summing infinite series, you would
actually get a finite and more astonshingly, a <em>negative number</em>  as a
result! </p>

<p>Where as you would expect the following to be true</p>

<p>1 + 2 + 3 + &hellip; = &infin;</p>

<p>Ramanujan posited that, if you broke just one rule, the result is
actually</p>

<p>1 + 2 + 3 + &hellip; = -1/12</p>

<p>What? Negative one twelfth!?</p>

<p>Watch the video below for a fascinating explanation of how you can derive
this result yourself. You only need a smattering of algebra to understand the
result, and it's arguable if you even need that.</p>

<h2><a href="https://peterattiamd.com/framework-for-nutrition-and-fasting">A framework for dieting</a></h2>

<p>There are a plethora of diets you can try to follow, but many are just
  small variations on others, and it's not always obvious what the underlying
  principles of the diet are. e.g. how does it work?, what kind of body
  chemistry does it hope to promote? does it involve calorie restriction or not? </p>

<p>The field of nutrition is full of nonsense but not all of it is nonsense.
Clearly there is such a thing as a good diet even if we don't know exactly what
it is. We certainly know there is such a thing as a bad diet.</p>

<p> If we were to liken it to the field of medicine I'd say we're still at the stage
where we think cholera is caused by miasmas, leeches are a considered a reasonable
therapy, and doctors still don't wash their hands. That is, we have a long way to go
until we really know just what constitutes a healthy diet and what doesn't.
David Chapman wrote a <a href="https://meaningness.com/nutrition">polemic</a>
outlining just how poor the knowledge base of nutrition really is.</p>

<p>However, todays video was made by Peter Attia who trying to change this
dismal situation. While he doesn't offer any answers in the video below, what he
does is present a <em>framework</em> for categorising diets that helps navigate the
world of dieting.</p>

<p>One part of the video I particular enjoyed is where is tells us that the standard
  American diet is precisely what you get when you optimise food production to be
the following four things:</p>

<ul>
<li>cheap</li>
<li>tasty</li>
<li>scalable. i.e. mass produced and easily transported to the consumer</li>
<li>portable i.e. easily carried by the consumer</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="https://byrnehobart.medium.com/the-30-year-mortgage-is-an-intrinsically-toxic-product-200c901746a">The 30 year mortgage is toxic</a></h2>

<p>The following article uses all sorts of jargon I still don't understand.
However, it's still worth a skim because it makes a convincing argument early on
that the 30 year mortgage is among the <em>last</em> investment vehicles that a
professional investor would use to grow their wealth. Yet, for most people, it's
the only investment vehicle they will ever use.</p>
