<p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was probably one of the most interesting figures in
mathematics in the 20th century if for his back-story alone. He grew up as part
of a poor family, in a part of India where, not only was he not provided with a
high quality mathematical education but &mdash; after he had defied the odds and
developed a  prodigious ability &mdash; had no one around him that could even
recognise his achievements. </p>

<p>At the age of 26 he wrote a <a
href="https://medium.com/cantors-paradise/ramanujans-first-letter-to-g-h-hardy-1913-33244f545e80">letter</a>
to  the famous mathematician G. H. Hardy. Unlike the trope one seens in many
movies, Hardy was not put off by Ramanujan's lack of formal education and
immediately recognised his ability and originality.</p>

<p>One of the results present in the paper had to do with summing the so-called
<em>natural numbers</em> which are just the ordinary (whole) counting numbers we use. He
made the claim that if you broke one of the rules of summing infinite series,
you would actually get a finite and <em>negative</em> result! </p>

<p>We would all expect that the following is true</p>

<math xmlns = "http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
         <mrow>
              1 + 2 + 3 + &hellip; = &infin;
         </mrow>
</math>

<p>But Ramanujan posited that, if you broke just one rule, the result is
  actually</p>

<math xmlns = "http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mrow>
       1 + 2 + 3 + &hellip; = <mfrac><mn>-1</mn><mi>12</mi></mfrac>
  </mrow>
</math>

<p>Watch the video below for a fascinating explanation of how one
  can get to this result. You don't even need high school maths to understand the
  result. i.e. no algebra, no calculus, no trigonometry, just basic addition.</p>
