<h1>Bitcoin uses too much electricity, the subtleties of breast feeding,
and how passive investing is distorting the market</h1>

<p>You might have heard that Bitcoin uses a lot of electricity. The reason for
this is quite technical but the short story is that Bitcoin relies on all the
people in the network to come to agreement on the transactions in the ledger. An
ingenious system called <em>mining</em> ensures that blocks of transactions can
only be stamped as authentic by solving a difficult maths problem. This is also
known as Proof of Work. Miners receive a significant reward for authenticating
blocks of transactions. At the time of writing this is 12.5 bitcoins or about
USD$600,000.</p>

<p>As more miners enter the Bitcoin network the difficulty of solving the
mathematical problem is increased. This is necessary for technical reasons I
just don't have space to go into in this newsletter, but the downside is that
more and more of the world's electricity is consumed. Worse still, the amount of
electricity that Bitcoin could use is <em>unbounded</em>.</p>

<p>Bitcoin was (and is) a bold experiment and its designers probably didn't see
this coming but it's become a huge problem. The combined electricity consumption
of all Bitcoin miners recently exceeded that of Argentina, a country of 45
million people.</p>

<p>This leads us to the article I'd like to share. It's a polemic against this
aspect of Bitcoin and makes the case that Bitcoin is an environmental and moral
disaster because of this design flaw.</p>

<p>I've recently become the father of an infant boy and discovered, as most
new parents do, that breast feeding doesn't just come naturally. It's a skill
that you need to develop.</p>

<p>I've watched quite a few breast feeding videos but this one is easily
the best. The animation of what goes on inside the baby's mouth at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjt-Ashodw8&t=1m15s">1:15</a> is
particularly insightful and I haven't seen the same information anywhere else.</p>

<h2><a href="https://youtu.be/K8siASXfeyU">Passive funds are distorting the markets</a></h2>

<p>So here's a question I've always wanted answered. Why does
superannuation work? After all, markets only work when investors inject information
into the system by buying stocks they think will succeed and selling ones they
think will fail. What happens when you simply leave these choices to other people?
Can the market work as it is supposed to? Will it not suffer because of the smaller
number of people who are actually making decisions about what to buy and sell? </p>

<p>It turns out that my suspicions are well founded although the explanation is
definitely way above my pay grade. Superannuation, index funds, managed funds,
and many other kinds of investment vehicles are examples of what is known as
<em>passive investing</em>. The defining characteristic of them is that you're
leaving the choice of what to invest in to someone else. The following video
goes into why passive investing is distorting the market, and incidentally,
explains why hedge funds have become more susceptible to "short squeezes" caused
by rallies like the infamous GameStop rally of the last few weeks.</p>

<p>This video is not for the faint of heart. Some of it went over my head but
the erudition of the interviewee, Mark Green, came through clearly.</p>
