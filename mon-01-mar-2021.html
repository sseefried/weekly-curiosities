">Most teen bullying occurs among peers climbing social ladder</a></h2>

<p>In school I was both bullied and a bully. I remember being told (by
well-meaning adults) that the reason bullies lash out is because of a lack of
self esteem or because of problems at home. Apart from the fact that bullies
appear to have anything <em>but</em> a lack of self-esteem, what if this is only part of
the story?</p>

<p>Intuitively, mosty of us recognise that there was a social ladder-climbing
aspect to bullying. Who can deny that making fun of someone didn't help but rub
off well on the person making fun, even if we felt bad for feeling that way? I
can distinctly remember how charismatic and funny it made them seem.</p>

<p>The article below shares some research showing that much of the bullying
seems to occur among friends who are trying to climb the social ladder. The
paper also presents evidence that most anti-bullying programs don't work. This
also accords with my experience. I distinctly remember how we were schooled in
how to recognise and call out bullying but, after just a few days, or even hours!,
we would be using the new vocabulary in the most sarcastic way with
each other, a metaphorical nod and wink to the fact that we all knew it wouldn't
have any meaningful effect. </p>

<p>It makes you wonder though, if you had the right foundation for understanding
bullying, one that recognised it wasn't just kids with problems at home that did it,
whether one might be able to craft some solutions that actually worked.</p>

<p>This is the second link from Stephen Diehl I've posted in this newsletter.
I'm not sure I agree with everything he has to say but I like his observation
that movements like Bitcoin and the GameStop (GME) phenomenon have one thing
in common: that part of the impetus for being involved in them is outrage at
the current economic order.</p>

<p>Remember when Groupon was a big thing? Did you start to realise that the
businesses you were getting great deals from were often struggling financially and
struggling  even more to honour the deal they had just given? Did it start to
make you feel guilty? You may have been, just as I was, part of the Locust
Economy, a metaphorical plague from the skies stripping small businesses down
to nothing.</p>
