<h1>What can you learn from primary sources about the COVID-19 lab-leak hypothesis?</h1>
<h2>Sun 20 June 2021</h2>
<hr>

<p>I'm going to break with my regular newsletter format (and conveniently ignore
the fact that I have not posted for several months) and share with you a few
thoughts I have about the COVID-19 lab-leak hypothesis.</p>

<p>You might remember that, in an earlier newsletter, I posted a link to a story
about the drug <em>hydroxychloroquine</em> and how political its use
became once it received support from Trump. It seems a similar thing happened
with the lab-leak hypothesis. My intention today is not to provide commentary
around whether I think the lab-leak hypothesis is true or not &mdash; I think it's
likely enough that it is worth investigating but no more than that &mdash; instead
it is to show what you can learn from <em>primary source
material</em>.</p>

<p>In a politically polarised media landscape it can be hard to discern truth
from fiction. Every fact is filtered, and often distorted, through the
narrative spin that journalists wish to put on the underlying facts.</p>

<p>Today I wish to present you with some facts that are often cited but may not
be as salient if not verified first hand.</p>

<p>The four facts I would like to present are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Furin cleavage sites have been identified as being a mechanism for increased
      infectiousness of coronavirus in humans</li>

  <li>A researcher from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), Shi Zhengli, in
  joint work with Ralph Baric engineered a chimeric virus with increased
  infectivity in 2015.</li>

  <li>Ralph Baric has recently signed his name to a statement declaring that the
    lab-leak hypothesis should not be ruled out
  </li>

  <li>Peter Daszak, a proponent of the natural origin hypothesis, remarks in
    a podcast released in December 2019 referencing the ability to modify
    viruses in the lab and mentioning Ralph Baric by name</li>
</ol>

<h2>Furin cleavage sites as a mechanism for increased infectivity in humans</h2>

Several papers have been published that demonstrate that adding a furin cleavage
site to a coronavirus increases its infectiousness. One example is a paper entitled
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2660061/">Activation of the SARS coronavirus spike protein via sequential proteolytic cleavage at two distinct sites</a>.

<p>A key quote from the paper is:</p>

<blockquote>
We also introduced a furin cleavage site at both the S2′ cleavage site within
S2 793-KPTKR-797 (S2′), as well as at the junction of S1 and S2. Introduction
of a furin cleavage site at the S2′ position allowed trypsin-independent
cell–cell fusion, which was strongly increased by the presence of a second
furin cleavage site at the S1–S2 position. Taken together, these data suggest
a novel priming mechanism for a viral fusion protein, with a critical
proteolytic cleavage event on the SARS-CoV S protein at position 797 (S2′),
acting in concert with the S1–S2 cleavage site to mediate membrane fusion and
virus infectivity.
</blockquote>

<p>Another paper called <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32869021/">Furin Cleavage Site Is Key to SARS-CoV-2 Pathogenesis</a> published on 26 August 2020 provided evidence
that the furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 (which causes COVID-19) was key
to its infectiousness</p>

<h2>Chimeric virus expressing a modified spike protein created by Shi Zhengli
and Ralph Baric</h2>

<p>In 2015 Shi Zhengli in joint work with Ralph Baric modified the spike protein
of an existing virus in order to make it more infectious.  </p>

<p>Paper: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985">A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence</a></p>

<p>I would like to point out the editor's note</p>

<blockquote>
We are aware that this article is being used as the basis for unverified
theories that the novel coronavirus causing COVID-19 was engineered. There is no
evidence that this is true; scientists believe that an animal is the most likely
source of the coronavirus.
</blockquote>

<p>It correctly asserts that the paper is not evidence of a lab origin for SARS-CoV-2.
The paper is not evidence of anything except the fact that tools and techniques
exist to readily modify existing viruses to increase their infectivity, and
that both Shi Zhengli and Ralph Baric have knowledge of these techniques, and
access to the resources necessary to apply them.</p>

<p>The key quote from the paper is:</p>

<blockquote>
Therefore, to examine the emergence potential (that is, the potential to
infect humans) of circulating bat CoVs, we built a chimeric virus encoding a
novel, zoonotic CoV spike protein—from the RsSHC014-CoV sequence that was
isolated from Chinese horseshoe bats in the context of the SARS-CoV
mouse-adapted backbone. The hybrid virus allowed us to evaluate the ability of
the novel spike protein to cause disease independently of other necessary
adaptive mutations in its natural backbone. Using this approach, we
characterized CoV infection mediated by the SHC014 spike protein in primary
human airway cells and in vivo, and tested the efficacy of available immune
therapeutics against SHC014-CoV. Together, the strategy translates
metagenomics data to help predict and prepare for future emergent viruses.
</blockquote>


<h2>Ralph Baric has recently signed an open letter suggesting further investigation of the lab leak hypthesis</h2>

<p>Ralph Baric, who was the scientist that co-engineered a virus with Shi
Zhengli in 2015, is one of 19 scientists that recently signed an open letter
published in Science imploring the scientific community  not to rule out the lab
leak hypothesis saying "We must take hypotheses about both natural and
laboratory spillovers seriously until we have sufficient data".</p>

<p>The article in Science can be found here: <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6543/694.1">Investigate
the origins of COVID-19</a>.</p>

<h2>Peter Daszak comments on Ralph Baric's work in podcast released in December 2019</h2>

<p>In an episode of <em>This Week in Virology</em>, released on <a
href="https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-615/">19 May 2021</a> Peter Daszak is
interviewed. At around the 29m50s mark he remarks that viruses can be easily
manipulated in the lab and that spike proteins "drive a lot of what happens" in
coronaviruses. Yet he has been a big proponent of the zoonotic origin theory
(which make still be the correct one).</p>

<p>Here's a link to the clip on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdYDL_RK--w&t=1790s">YouTube</a>.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Both the lab-leak and zoonotic origin hypotheses have evidence in favour of
them but neither has conclusive evidence that makes it clearly correct. At this
point we simply don't have the evidence to rule out either one and, as such,
both should remain on the table.</p>

<p>I would urge people to try their hand at digging through primary source material
when reading about this particular issue and for similarly "politically hot" topics.
It's quite remarkable what you can find with only a modicum of searching on the
Internet. Many claims made in newspaper articles can be decisively debunked
merely by doing a bit of reading of primary source material.</p>
