<h1>An interview with Aldous Huxley, the reality of being poor, F-16 avoids
crashing into the ground, and that drone video in the bowling alley</h1>

  An interview with the author of Brave New World</a></h2>

<p>Aldous Huxley published a famous novel titled <em>Brave New World</em>
outlining a dystopian future very different from George Orwell's <em>1984</em> and
one that, in my opinion, more accurately reflects the dystopian elements of our
society. There's even a nice <a
href="https://biblioklept.org/2013/06/08/huxley-vs-orwell-the-webcomic-2/">comic</a>
comparing the two literary works. It was also recently made into a <a
href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9814116/">television series</a> which,
although departing from the plot of the original book, does manage to capture
the general <em>feel</em> of the society depicted in the book very well. </p>

<p>Although Brave New World was published in 1932 the interview I'm linking to
was done in 1958. The world had changed enormously. There had even been a world
war in the intervening time yet Huxley felt that his dystopian vision was even
closer to being realised than when he originally wrote the novel.</p>

<p>One part of the interview I particularly liked had to do with his criticism
of Madison Avenue's brand of advertising. Huxley believed it bypassed our
rational faculties by appealing directly to our more base desires. This was a
catastrophe from his point of view as he believed one of the important foundations
one required for a healthy democracy was that people made <em>conscious</em>
decisions as opposed to unconscious ones. I wonder what he would make of the
even more crafty advertising of today that not only bypasses our critical faculties
but is <em>tailor made</em> for our individual predilections.</p>

<h2><a href="">The Reality of Being Poor-ish</a></h2>

<p>People have this very deep seated intuition that work should be paid in
proportion to the difficulty of the job. Coming to the realisation and
acceptance that it doesn't work this way is, I think, an important part of
one's self development and even empowerment.</p>

<p>In reality people are paid in proportion to the <em>rarity</em> and
<em>perceived value</em> of the skill they are providing. This is why a kitchen
worker can work themselves to the bone, be treated awfully by their superiors,
and still be paid a pittance while a highly skilled lawyer can charge so much
for each hour of their time. The motto of the story here is: try not to be
<em>replaceable</em> and try not specialise in a skill that is perceived as
<em>low value</em>.</p>

<p>But even this formulation isn't the full story. I was struck by some
additional information in this quote from the article.</p>

<blockquote>
The worst treatment you tend to get is, perhaps counterintuitively, in jobs
that approach living wage despite your low value and replaceability as a
worker. These jobs tend towards needing someone who can put in a lot of hours
for customer interactions that require a single point of contact; they reward
intense focus over long periods of time in unpleasant situations. Another way
to say this is that these are high-stress jobs with a lot of mandatory
overtime and very fast pacing - they pay a lot because they can’t get people
to do them otherwise. Turnover in these jobs is absurd despite the pay - some
people can keep up with them but it isn’t typical. In my first (and hopefully
last) claims adjuster job, two people had heart attacks in my office in a six
month period.
</blockquote>

<p>This provides a nod to the idea that replaceability and low value are
determining factors in what you are paid (and how you are treated) but that
there is another factor at play. Some jobs, in addition, require <em>high
responsibility</em> which is a bargaining chip increased wages. However, as the
quote above makes clear, the worst combo appears to be high responsibility
coupled with highly replaceable/low value work.</p>

<p>The rest of the article is also great and refreshingly free of jealousy
towards rich people! It outlines how poverty creates all sorts of negative
feedback loops in your life making it hard to escape from. I found the part
about the ever-looming spectre of car repairs riveting. It is well worth a
read.</p>

<h2><a href="https://youtu.be/WkZGL7RQBVw">F-16's computer pulls out of a 9.1G dive and saves pilot</a></h2>

<p>In this video you see an F-16's <em>Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance
System</em> do exactly that and save a pilot's life. Within the space of only a
few seconds he drops from 15000ft to 4000ft. In fact, the pilot blacked out
because of the G forces and would certainly have perished without the assistance
of system.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgS54fqKxf0">Right Up Our Alley</a></h2>

<p>I got into FPV drones in May 2020, and I got in pretty deep, learning to build my own
from parts. I've tried my hand at a bunch of different hobbies over the years
but this is the first one in a long time that has brought such unbridled joy.
In a few months my gear and my flying skill improved a lot. I went from <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4yhsNdJO1I">this</a> to <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjjtz3cTu8">this</a> in a few short months.</p>

<p>Just recently a single-take FPV drone video, showing the inner workings of a
bowling alley, has gone viral. It's a beautiful bit of flying and there's some
great audio work in there too. Spot the Big Lebowski reference if you can. Also,
check out this  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8Ao_AripYc">behind the
scenes</a> video to learn more about how they pulled off the shot. In
particular, I use the same <a href="https://www.dji.com/au/fpv">DJI Digital FPV
system</a> that the pilot does. </p>
