<h1>The making of a Daft Punk loop, bike friendliness and the politicisation of hydroxychloroquine</h1>

<h2><a href="https://youtu.be/5QwOpRh-IfI">The making of Daft Punk's <em>One More Time</em></a></h2>

<p>This wonderfully animated clip shows how to get the main loop of Daft Punk's
<em>One More Time</em> from Eddie Johns' <em>More Spell On You</em>. There's a lot going on in
the animation and it proves that, if done right, visual communication can pack
in an awful lot of information in just a few seconds. I found the following
"visual vocabulary" quite innovative:</p>

<ul>
  <li>highlighting sections of the original song showing us which bits were chopped out</li>
  <li>the white line that shows us the point that is currently playing in the sample</li>
  <li>the stretching of the sample which has the effect of lowering the frequency</li>
</ul>

<p>There's 36 more videos just like it which I'm looking forward to watching.</p>

<h2><a href="https://youtu.be/SJ_urYOBNcs">Making Melbourne's Brunswick St
more bike friendly</a></h2>

<p>I rode along Brunswick St many times in the year that I lived in
Melbourne. I can personally attest to how dangerous it felt. I was in a traffic
limbo, caught between the threat of car doors being opened on me to my left
and vehicles 10-20 times my mass plowing into me from the right.</p>

<p>Watch the video below to see some suggestions on how Brunswick St could be
improved.</p>

<p>I was following hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment for COVID-19
before Trump had showed any support for it. I even donated to a
Queensland trial of the drug. But everything changed once Trump declared his
support for the drug. All of a sudden it became highly politicised. People on
the right touted it as a miracle cure, while people on the left cast as much
doubt on it as they could.</p>

<p>The truth was somewhere in between as you'll discover in Norman Doidge's
article. Other works by him include the books
<em>The Brain That Changes Itself</em> and <em>The Brain's Way of Healing</em>.</p>
